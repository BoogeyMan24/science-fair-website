This is the code for the website that was used to collect data through for the 2023 Science Fair. 
I know the code is a bit scuffed, but to my credit I was in a rush to finish it before the science fair deadline and it was before I discovered actual proper frameworks like sveltekit which I use now.
This website was self-hosted on a raspberry pi with nginx. I am still amazed that I managed to self-host it as it was not easy at all to set up.
