This is the code for the website that was used to collect data through for the 2023 Science Fair. 

I know the code is a bit scuffed, but to my credit I was in a rush to finish it before the science fair deadline and it was before I discovered actual proper frameworks like sveltekit which I use now.

I used node with express and mongodb to practicly duck tape this together (I am still proud though).

This website was self-hosted on a raspberry pi with nginx. I am still amazed that I managed to self-host it as it was not easy at all to set up.

(This project did technically win first place as it recieved the highest amount of points out of any other, but the school somehow messed up when judging the projects and so decided to not announce any official winners)
