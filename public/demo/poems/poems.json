		"poem": "When winter's icy grip doth take its hold,<br>And all around is draped in sheets of white,<br>The world is hushed, as if a tale untold,<br>As snowflakes dance and twirl into the night.<br><br>The trees stand bare, their branches stark and cold,<br>A sight that seems to chill the very soul,<br>Yet deep beneath the earth, new life doth hold,<br>A promise of the spring to come, made whole.<br><br>The hearth doth blaze with warmth and flickering light,<br>A refuge from the biting winter's breath,<br>And in its glow, we while away the night,<br>Awaiting the return of life and death.<br><br>Thus winter's grip, though harsh and unforgiving,<br>Holds within it the promise of new living."
